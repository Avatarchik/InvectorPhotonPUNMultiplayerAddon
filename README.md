5. Download PUN 2 from the Asset Store to Unity (NOT PUN)

7. Done!

## Setup
There isn't an official release for this since there are still a series of issues I am working through. If you want to jump ahead of the game and figure them out yourself just download the "PUNMultiplayerInvectorAddon" folder and import that into your project.
